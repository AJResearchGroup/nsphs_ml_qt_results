### Genotype concordance

A measure of how well the genotypes are compressed,
which is a value from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).

#### p0

`p0` is an overly simple phenotype model

> Genotype concordance in one plot

> Genotype concordance in a facet grid

### p1

`p1` is a useful phenotype model

### Normalized mean squared error

A measure of the error in phenotype prediction,
which is a value from 0 (perfect prediction) to infinity (useless prediction).
